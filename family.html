    <p>Learning Goals: <br>
      <ul>Offspring Inherit traits from their parents, but are ot identical to their parents</ul>
      <ul>There is variation within a population</ul>
    </p>
    <!--Insert picture of a pikachu family-->
    <p>This is a family photo of the pikachu family. There is a Mom, a Dad, and a baby. The baby looks like the Mom and the Dad. This is because the baby inherited <b>traits</b> from each parent. </p>
    <p>Looking at the picture, determine which parent the baby got each trait from</p>
    <!--Insert a quiz with mom, dad, both for : eyes, nose, ears, mouth, tail-->
    <p>Optional: Take a look at a family photo with your parents. Determine which parent passed on each trait to you.</p>
    <!--Insert a quiz for hair color, eye color, nose shape, ear shape-->

    <p>Do children look exactly like their parents? Why or why not?</p>
    <!--Insert yes/no multiple choice and free response box-->

    <p>But wait! There are also traits that children might have that neither of their parents had. These are called <b>mutations</b> and they come from the process of combining the DNA from each parent
    <ul>
      <li>Sometimes these mutations can not be seen and do not make a difference</li>
      <li>Sometimes these mutations can be seen, and help the children survive to pass on these traits to their children</li>
      <li>Sometimes these mutations hurt the child, and so the child does not survive and so it can't pass them on to future children.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Make a prediction</h2>
    <p>What do you think will happen to the traits of a species over thousands of years?</p>
