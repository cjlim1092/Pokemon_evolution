    <p>When the Alola region was introduced, a whole new world of tropical pokemon were revealed. Some of these pokemon were similar to pokemon we have seen before, but with slight differences. <br>
    What are some differences in traits that you see between Exeggutors?</p>
    <!--Insert text box here-->
    <p>How do you think these traits might be advantageous in a tropical island environment? </p>

        <!--Multiple choice, this is an example of natural selection-->

        <!--Insert picture of dugtrio-->
    <p>Other Alolan traits might not be due to natural selection, but just by random chance.</p>
    <!--Do you think this is an example of natural seletion or random chance?-->
    <!--Do you think this is evolution? Why or why not? / include feedback-->
