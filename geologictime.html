    <p>If you take a look at Lapras and Squirtle, you can see that they have some shared traits. They are both water types, they both have hard shells, and they both have beaks.</p>
    <p>They probably share some traits because they have a <b>common ancestor</b>. To figure out the common acestor, we would have to look for evidence in the fossil record. Pokemon fossils show use pokemon that have been long extinct, but they do prove that pokemon have been around for millions of years. So we can look at these fossils and guess to see where they might have a common ancestor.</p>

      <img width="100%" src="images/timelineLapras1.png" alt="Lapras 2">
    </div>
    <p><b>Evolution</b> doesn't happen all at once. It is a gradual process shaped through random mutations and <b>natural selection</b>. Natural selection is when traits that are beneficial to survival are passed down in a species by chance. In the case of lapras, this could be flippers that are slightly bigger to help it swim. In the squirtle, this could be flippers that have bigger toes which help it spend more time on land. If you turn back the clock far enough the two species have roots into a tirtouga family. But today, squirtles, laparases, and tirtougas can not have babies together because they are no longer the same species. </p>
    <!--Insert a family tree with squirtle, lapras and tirtouga where students can mark the common ancestor-->

    <p>So this is evolution! <br><br>
      Did the evolution of the squirtle and laparas happen over a short period of time or a long period of time? </p>
    <!--Insert a multiple choice answer-->
    <p>The evolution happened over a <input id="time1" placeholder="long or short?" width="100%">  period of time.</p>
    <p>Does evolution happen to an individual or a species?</p>
