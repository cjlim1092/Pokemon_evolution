    <p>This module is written for elementary school science. Pokemon is a popular game that has been around for more than 20 years. Players train and <i>evolve</i> their Pokemon to fight opponents. However, this has led to widespread misconceptions when trainers learn about biological evolution. This module aims to teach young trainers about biological evolution using Pokemon.  </p>
